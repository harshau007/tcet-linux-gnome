In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/blob/main/README.md) file. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Contributing to TCET-Opensource Externally](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/resources/workflows/external-workflow/)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see documentation of [TCET Linux](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/projects/tcet-linux/about-tcet-linux/) :confetti_ball:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/issues).

#### Solve an issue

1. Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 

2. See [Good First Issues](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label for beginner issues. 

3. Leave a comment to get it assigned.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install or update **archiso**, for creating ISO. For more information, see [How to build ISO](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/tree/main#how-to-build-iso).

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the PR template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a DevOps team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
